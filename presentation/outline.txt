   roosterfs (?)
   a filesystem using crash concurrent separation hoare logic

parts of the problem
   crash concurrent separation hoare logic
   soundness proof of same
   a file system specification
   a file system
   a proof of the file system

logic
   we thought pulling together the logic wouldn't be that big a deal
   we were wrong

rob talks here

file system specification
   david spend a while flailing trying to figure out how to write down
   things without having the logic ready
   and especially the ast that goes with the logic

david exhibits the current specs here

file system
   writing this is substantially more dependent on the ast and logic
   david has some stuff but it's not ready to be exhibited

proofs
   we have bupkis so far, pretty much

conclusions
   ?
