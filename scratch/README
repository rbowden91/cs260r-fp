After cloning repo, we need to compile CompCert. First, be sure you have all the prerequisites mentioned at
http://compcert.inria.fr/man/manual002.html, including Coq, OCaml, and Menhir. On this manual page, under installation,
you'll also want to look for the target prefix for your machine and replace it in the ./configure command below.

1) git submodule init

2) git submodule update

(Alternatively, when initially cloning the repo, passing the --recursive clone to git clone will have done these first
two steps.)

3) Open up compcert/exportclight/ExportClight.ml and change the "let prologue" binding from:

let prologue = "\n\
Require Import Clightdefs.\n\
\
Local Open Scope Z_scope.\n\
\
"

to:

let prologue = "\n\
Require Import compcert.exportclight.Clightdefs.\n\
\
Local Open Scope Z_scope.\n\
\
"


This is definitely not the right way of doing this, but it was my quick workaround instead of figuring out coqc.


4) cd compcert && ./configure x86_64-macosx && make

This will take a bit, but you should hopefully only have to do it once.


Now in the toplevel directory, "make" will currently translate all csrc/*.c files to csrc/*.v files and compile them to
.vo files (so that you can Require Import them). See CminorExample.v for an example of playing with one of these files.

You may still need to separately compile, e.g., SepCancel.v for use in CSL.v. For now, a simple "coqc SepCancel.v"
handles that.
